Mr. Palaniswami said, “There is nothing to hide regarding deaths due to COVID-19, and they cannot be covered up. Today, if someone dies due to COVID-19, everyone comes to know about it and it cannot be hidden. Deaths reported in government hospitals and data of deaths due to COVID-19 in private hospitals is collected and reported. The government has got nothing to benefit by hiding these deaths. Every day, through the Health Department, details of the number of persons tested, number of active cases and number of patients discharged are being announced transparently.” He added that within the country, the death rate [for COVID-19] was the lowest in Tamil Nadu.
